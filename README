== DESCRIPTION:

Aspen is a web server engine for JRuby. The design is very similar
to Thin (http://code.macournoyer.com/thin/), except
using Netty (http://www.jboss.org/netty) for high-speed concurrent sockets.

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

* truly concurrent socket model
* Rack interface support
* Not all features implemented yet, such as chunked data, different content encodings, etc.

== SYNOPSIS:

  FIXME (code sample of usage)

== REQUIREMENTS:

* Java >= 1.5
* JRuby >= 1.4
* Rack

== INSTALL:

	# From Gemcutter / Rubyforge ...
	$ (sudo) jruby -S gem install aspen

== INSTALL FROM SOURCE:

    # get source from Github
    $ git clone git://github.com/kevwil/aspen.git
    $ cd aspen

    # You must have JRuby set up, with the dependent gems installed.
    # see the Rakefile for the dev-time dependencies
    $ jgem install little-plugger loquacious rubyforge bones bones-git bones-extras rspec mocha rcov

    # You must have Ant and Maven set up.
    # *note* the Rakefile will call Maven in "offline mode".
    # If you get any errors about unresolved dependencies, do this:
    $ cd javalib
    $ mvn dependency:go-offline
    # or
    $ mvn package
